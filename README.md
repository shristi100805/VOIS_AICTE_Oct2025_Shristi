This project analyzes the Airbnb Open Dataset to gain insights into the New York City Airbnb market. The analysis includes data cleaning and preprocessing, exploring different property types, identifying the neighbourhood groups with the highest listings and average prices, examining the relationship between construction year and price, identifying top hosts, and investigating the relationship between host identity verification and review rates. The goal is to uncover trends and patterns within the dataset that can provide a better understanding of the factors influencing Airbnb listings and their performance in NYC.
